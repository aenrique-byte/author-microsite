# ImageManager Unification Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for unifying the ImageManager module under the main homepage, following the same integration pattern used for Storytime. The goal is to have everything controlled by the unified admin console and driven by the unified MySQL database.

## Current Status

### âœ… Already Unified
- **Main Website**: Author homepage with unified admin console
- **Storytime**: Completely integrated with unified database and admin control
- **Database Schema**: Unified `aenriqu_author_cms` database with all necessary tables
- **API Infrastructure**: Complete backend with authentication and moderation
- **Admin Console**: Unified moderation system handling both image and chapter comments

### ðŸ”„ Needs Integration
- **ImageManager Frontend**: Currently using separate API configuration
- **ImageManager APIs**: Located in separate `imagemanager/api/` folder
- **ImageManager Authentication**: Not using unified session system
- **Build/Deployment**: Not integrated with main site structure

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: API Migration & Database Unification

#### 1.1 Move ImageManager APIs to Main API Folder
**Objective**: Consolidate all APIs under main `/api` folder

**Steps**:
1. **Copy ImageManager API endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Copy all API files from imagemanager/api/ to main api/ folder
   cp -r imagemanager/api/galleries/ api/
   cp -r imagemanager/api/images/ api/
   cp imagemanager/api/galleries.php api/
   ```

2. **Update API configurations**:
   - Modify all imagemanager API files to use unified database config
   - Replace imagemanager database connection with main config
   - Update file paths and includes to work from main API folder

3. **Integration points**:
   - `imagemanager/api/bootstrap.php` â†’ integrate with `api/bootstrap.php`
   - `imagemanager/api/config.php` â†’ remove, use main `api/config.php`
   - Update all API endpoints to use unified authentication

#### 1.2 Database Integration Verification
**Objective**: Ensure imagemanager uses unified database

**Steps**:
1. **Verify current database usage**:
   - Check if imagemanager is already using `aenriqu_author_cms`
   - Confirm unified schema is being used

2. **Remove separate database references**:
   - Delete `imagemanager/api/config.php`
   - Update any hardcoded database references

**Note**: Any data migration will be handled manually via file uploads, so no automated migration scripts are needed.

#### 1.3 Authentication System Integration
**Objective**: Use unified authentication across all sections

**Steps**:
1. **Update imagemanager APIs**:
   - Replace imagemanager auth with unified session system
   - Ensure all protected endpoints use main auth middleware
   - Update user role checking to use unified system

2. **Session management**:
   - Ensure imagemanager frontend can read unified session
   - Update login/logout flows to work with main system

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration & Configuration

#### 2.1 Update ImageManager Frontend Configuration
**Objective**: Point imagemanager to unified APIs

**Steps**:
1. **Update API base URL**:
   ```typescript
   // In imagemanager/src/lib/apiBase.ts
   export const API_BASE = '/api'; // Change from imagemanager-specific path
   ```

2. **Authentication integration**:
   - Update login components to use unified auth endpoints
   - Ensure session state is shared with main site
   - Update user context to work with unified system

3. **Social media integration**:
   - Update social icons to fetch from unified database
   - Ensure consistency with main site and storytime

#### 2.2 Navigation & Branding Integration
**Objective**: Seamless navigation between all sections

**Steps**:
1. **Add navigation links**:
   - Add "Home" link to main author page
   - Add "Stories" link to storytime section
   - Ensure consistent header/navigation design

2. **Styling consistency**:
   - Verify imagemanager uses same design system
   - Update any inconsistent styling to match main site
   - Ensure dark/light theme consistency

3. **Cross-linking**:
   - Add imagemanager link to main homepage
   - Add imagemanager link to storytime navigation
   - Update admin console to include gallery management

### Phase 3: Build & Deployment Integration

#### 3.1 Configure Build Output Structure
**Objective**: Deploy imagemanager to `/galleries` path

**Steps**:
1. **Update build configuration**:
   ```javascript
   // In imagemanager/vite.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/galleries/',
     build: {
       outDir: '../galleries' // Output to main site's galleries folder
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Update routing configuration**:
   - Configure SPA routing for `/galleries` path
   - Update .htaccess to handle imagemanager routes
   - Ensure proper fallback to index.html

3. **Build process integration**:
   - Update build scripts to output to correct location
   - Ensure assets are properly referenced with base path
   - Test build output works from `/galleries` path

#### 3.2 File Structure Unification
**Objective**: Integrate with unified file structure

**Steps**:
1. **Uploads directory**:
   - Ensure imagemanager uses main uploads directory
   - Update file paths in database if needed
   - Consolidate upload handling

2. **Remove duplicate files**:
   - Delete `imagemanager/api/` folder after migration
   - Remove duplicate configuration files
   - Clean up any unused imagemanager-specific files

3. **Update deployment structure**:
   ```
   aenrique.com/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (Author Homepage)
   â”œâ”€â”€ admin/ (Unified Admin Console)
   â”œâ”€â”€ galleries/ (ImageManager - integrated)
   â”œâ”€â”€ stories/ (Storytime - already integrated)
   â”œâ”€â”€ api/ (Unified Backend)
   â””â”€â”€ uploads/ (Unified uploads)
   ```

### Phase 4: Admin Console Integration & Testing

#### 4.1 Unified Admin Management
**Objective**: Manage imagemanager through unified admin

**Steps**:
1. **Gallery management integration**:
   - Verify gallery CRUD operations work through main admin
   - Test image upload and management
   - Ensure proper permissions and role checking

2. **Comment moderation**:
   - Verify image comments appear in unified moderation system
   - Test comment approval/rejection for images
   - Ensure IP banning works for image comments

3. **User management**:
   - Test admin user creation and management
   - Verify role-based access control
   - Ensure session management works across all sections

#### 4.2 Final Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of unified system

**Steps**:
1. **Functionality testing**:
   - Test gallery browsing and image viewing
   - Verify image upload and management
   - Test comment system and moderation
   - Validate search and filtering

2. **Integration testing**:
   - Test navigation between homepage, galleries, and stories
   - Verify authentication works across all sections
   - Test social media links consistency
   - Validate admin console manages all content

3. **Performance testing**:
   - Test loading times and responsiveness
   - Verify image optimization and caching
   - Test mobile responsiveness

4. **Security testing**:
